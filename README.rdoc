== Twitter Clone

This is a sample application that is basically empty at this point.

A complete version of this application would have:

1. A public feed of users' posts at '/'
2. Allow users to follow each other.
3. A feed for each user at '/users/<username>/'. This view should show who the user is following and his/her followers.

The application has been set up with Devise for user authentication and login
with the 'user' model.
